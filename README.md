## **Description**

- This is a Sales Insights Analysis project.
- In this project, the sales made by a pizza-selling café are analyzed.
- The café wants to know which are the high-performing and low-performing pizzas, at which time of the year the highest and lowest sales are made, and what size of pizza does people prefer to order.
- 	The business questions were answered by leveraging SQL queries.
-  The insights collected were then visualized using PowerBI. 


## **Methodology**
-	Initially, I started by understanding the dataset with over 48500 rows.
-	I then did some basic cleaning of this dataset. 
-	I uploaded the dataset on MySQL and then wrote queries to gain insights regarding the business questions.
-	Lastly, I uploaded the data set in PowerBI and made a dashboard to sum up all the gathered insights.-


## **Analysis**
- Total revenue and average revenue made in a fiscal year.
- Total pizzas sold
- Average order value 
- Average pizzas sold per order
-	Best and worst performing months
-	Pizza category-wise and size-wise sales analysis
-	Top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue and order


## **Outcome**
-	By understanding the performance category-wise and size-wise of each pizza, the café owner can decide what kind of offers to apply and at what time of the year.
-	This analysis can boost sales for them and in turn increase their revenue.
